    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been written. You will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions for this project. Unless it is requested, do not modify any of the code that has already been included. In this template code, there are four sections which you must complete to successfully produce a prediction with your model. Each section where you will write code is preceded by a **STEP X** header with comments describing what must be done. Please read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer that relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **QUESTION X** header. Be sure that you have carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the text boxes that begin with \"**Answer:**\". Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions.  \n",

    "1. **Preventing model overfitting** - models generated and assessed based on a single train / test split could be optimized to be very predictive for that given split test set, but poorly generalize to predictions from the larger data set or future data points from the population studied. Cross validating allows us to evaluate our models based on performance over many test and training subsets, providing more confidence that our model predictions can generalize with strong predictive accuracy for any data points from the studied population.\n",

    "2. **Making better use of limited data** - to construct a more predictive model, we want to maximize the number of data points in the test and training sets.

As the maximum depth parameter is increased beyond 4, training error continues to decrease (at a less rapid rate), but testing error bounces around and only slightly falls for some larger maximum depth values.\n",

    "At a maximum depth of 4, the total testing error level is relatively small (indicating low model bias) and this measure is only slightly improved with larger maximum depth parameter values. We would also like to minimize model complexity, controlling for predictive accuracy. Thus it is preferable retain a maximum depth of 4, instead of raising model complexity without marked improvements in model performance."

In this project, the optimization below is performed on the *entire dataset* (as opposed to the training set you made above) due to the many outliers in the data. Using the entire dataset for training provides for a less volatile prediction at the expense of not testing your model's performance. \n",

    "I would potentially consider using the model here for generating baseline estimates of house sale values for new clients, provided that I was confident about affirmative answers to the questions below.\n",

    "- **Do other features of the house's region (other than those used in the model) or physical characteristics roughly resemble those from the dataset?**  \n",
    "If there are characteristics of the house that are much different from those sampled for dataset, I may not be sure that we could consider this house as part of our 'housing population' for the model, and would not be confident about whether we can accurately generalize model predictions to the house. Certain features excluded from the dataset (e.g. a spectactular view) could have a substantial impact on selling value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Have labels (median home price) and feature values for the dataset been updated recently?**\n",
    "If I am using the model to project home prices in the future, I want to ensure that both feature and label values are recent. Otherwise the estimates of current sale value may be inaccurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Are there no cost-effective ways to obtain a richer dataset?**\n",
    "If I could more easily incorporate more predictive features and more data points in the dataset (reducing mean squared error for test set runs), I may choose to do so - potentially re-tuning the model as part of the exercise."
